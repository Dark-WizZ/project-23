# <p align="center">Restaurant E-commerce Web Application</p>
# Abstract
&emsp;&emsp;This project involves building a web application that is dedicated to restaurants. The application will enable restaurant owners to list their foods, take orders, and deliver them to their customers.
# Software requirements
- Operating System: Any modern operating system that can run a web browser
- Web Browser: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Microsoft Edge, etcâ€¦
- Internet Connection: High-speed internet connection for optimal performance
- IDE: Visual Studio Code or any text editor that can handle web development languages
- Framework: React.js for front-end development.
- Database: FireBase for storing restaurant and customer data

# Design and Working:

&emsp;&emsp;It is aimed at providing a user-friendly and intuitive front-end to facilitate seamless navigation for users. Restaurant owners will have the ability to create a personalized profile, list their food items and manage orders through a dedicated dashboard. Upon registration, each restaurant owner will be assigned a unique URL for their restaurant, which they can utilize to showcase their menus and receive orders. Customers, in turn, will have the convenience of browsing through the various menus and placing their orders through the designated URL.

# Working Walkthrough
- Restaurant owners create a profile and list their foods on the app

- Customers track their orders through the app



# Advantages
- **Ease of use:** This design specifically for small Restaurants and is easy to set up and use. It has a user-friendly interface that makes it easy for business owners to manage their online orders.
- **Control over the customer experience:** Restaurants have complete control over their customer service, and branding, allowing them to create a unique customer experience.
- **More Reach:** Provides an easy way for restaurant owners to expand their customer base.
- **Customer Satisfaction:** Streamlines the ordering process for customers, leading to increased satisfaction
# Limitations
- **Limited customization options**: While the website will be tailored to the specific needs of restaurants, there may still be some limitations to the level of customization that can be done. This may be due to the resources available to the developers.
- **Dependence on third-party services:** A web application may rely on third-party services for certain features, such as payment processing or delivery. This introduces a level of dependency on these services and can lead to issues if they experience downtime or other problems.
- **Competition:** The online food ordering and delivery market is highly competitive, with many players in the space. It can be difficult to gain market share and establish a strong brand presence
